/**
 * Guards, locks, and atomically installs a strictly-newer sandbox Codex
 * `auth.json` onto the shared host credential at teardown.
 *
 * Sequence, all under `withDirectoryMergeLock` on the host target's directory
 * so a concurrent inbound restore or another copy-back can't interleave:
 *   1. Read the sandbox credential bytes. A genuinely absent sandbox
 *      `auth.json` (ENOENT) means there is simply nothing to copy back, so it
 *      resolves to `kept-host` (benign no-op, host untouched); every other read
 *      error stays fail-loud.
 *   2. Stage them to a `0600` temp file on the **same filesystem** as the host
 *      target (its directory), which doubles as the predicate `source`.
 *   3. Run the Phase-3 decision predicate (`source` = sandbox temp, `destination`
 *      = host). Exit 10 → adopt the sandbox copy; exit 20 → keep the host copy.
 *   4. On exit 10, `rename` the staged temp over the host target — an atomic
 *      same-directory swap that preserves mode `0600`. On exit 20, discard it.
 * The staged temp is always removed (rename consumes it on the copy path; the
 * finally cleans it up otherwise), so a failure never leaves a partial file.
 * Never logs token bytes — only the decision outcome.
